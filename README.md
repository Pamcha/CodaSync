An easy-to-use database system for your Unity Games based on Coda.io.
With Coda Sync for Unity, you create and edit all your gameâ€™s data in a collaborative environment designed for teams!

Coda Sync for Unity allows you to synchronize the tables you have created in a coda doc (on coda.io) in your Unity Project.
Your data are imported as Scriptable Objects by automatically generating a class and its instances, and ready to be used anywhere in your code or in the inspector.

You can sync again any time, whenever you have made a change to your data on your doc(s).

Full description and documentation available here: https://coda.io/@utku-kaplan/coda-sync

Please note that you need to create a free account on coda.io to create your docs. Coda.io offers a generous free tier that should cover most of your needs.
