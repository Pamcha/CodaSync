Coda Sync for Unity allows you to synchronize the tables you have created in a coda doc (on coda.io) in your Unity Project.
Your data are imported as Scriptable Objects by automatically generating a class and its instances, and ready to be used anywhere in your code or in the inspector.

You can sync again any time, whenever you have made a change to your data on your doc(s).
